    <p><strong>Khaled Hosseini </strong> is an Afghan-American <i>novelist</i>, 
        UNHCR goodwill ambassador, and former physician. His debut novel 
        The Kite Runner was a critical and commercial success; the book and his
         subsequent novels have all been at least partially set in
         <strong>Afghanistan</strong> and have featured an Afghan as the protagonist..</p>
     
        <p>Born in <b>Kabul</b> to a diplomat father, 
          Hosseini spent some time living in Iran and France. 
          When Hosseini was 15, his family applied for asylum in the United States, 
          where he later became a naturalized citizen. Hosseini did not return to Afghanistan until
           2003[3] when he was 38, an experience similar to that of the protagonist in <em>The Kite Runner</em>. 
           In later interviews, Hosseini admitted to feeling survivor's guilt for having been 
          able to leave the country prior to the Soviet invasion and subsequent wars.</p>

            <p> <strong>Hosseini</strong> graduated from Independence High School
               in San Jose in 1984 and enrolled at Santa Clara University,
                where he earned a bachelor's degree in biology in 1988.
                 The following year, he entered the University of California San Diego School of Medicine, 
                 where he earned his M.D. in 1993.
               He completed his residency in internal medicine at <em>Cedars-Sinai Medical Center</em> in
                Los Angeles in 1997

        <dd>  Amir, a well-to-do Pashtun boy, and Hassan, a Hazara boy who is the son of Ali,
           Amir's father's servant, spend their days kite fighting in the hitherto peaceful
            city of Kabul. Flying kites was a way to escape the horrific reality the two boys were living in.
             Hassan is a successful "kite runner" for Amir; he knows where the kite will land without watching it.
              Both boys are motherless:
           Amir's mother died in childbirth, while Hassan's mother, 
           Sanaubar, simply abandoned him and Ali.

      <dd>The novel opens in the year 1952. Saboor, an impoverished farmer from
         the fictional village of Shadbagh, decides to sell his three-year-old daughter
         Pari to a wealthy, childless couple in Kabul. Abdullah adores Pari, and helps
          collect various feathers for her which she loves. Once, he sold a pair of his 
          shoes for a peacock feather because he knew Pari would treasure it.
           Ignorant of his father's plans, 10 year old Abdullah, 
           who has raised Pari since their mother died giving birth to her,
         insists on following when his father departs from the village to Kabul with Pari.</dd>
